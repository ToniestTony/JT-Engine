# JT Engine

The JT Engine is a 2D web game/app engine based on the [JT Library](https://github.com/ToniestTony/jt_lib). The goal is to quickly make 2D web games and apps while still giving total control to the programmer.

See a complete documentation of every functions of the JT Library and the JT Engine, try it [here](https://toniesttony.github.io/jt.html#jte).




## Examples

-[Here](http://ynotplay.ca/jeu.html?id=flamehead) is a small game that I first made to test the engine.

-[Here](https://todojt.netlify.app/) is a small todo list.

-[Here](https://music-listen-lite.netlify.app/) is a music listen quiz (takes a bit to load because of the music)

-[Here](http://ynotplay.ca/jeu.html?id=outOfControl) is a big warioware style game (takes a bit to load because of all the assets)

These are only a couple of games/apps I've made to show you the potential of the JT Engine.

## Features

- Use the full power of the [JT Library](https://github.com/ToniestTony/jt_lib) to make any types of games/apps.
- Use the settings menu to name and change the main elements of your game.
- Use the create menu to easily add objects, assets and color.
- Use the play menu to easily test, import and export your creations.
- Use the view window to rearrange and reshape your objects.
- Use the views window to easily see all your objects and better organize your projects. 
- Use the inspector window to easily change the attributes of your objects.
- Use the tileset window to easily manipulate and create many tiles.

## Roadmap

The engine is mostly finished, but I would still like to add some features and make it more user-friendly.

- Faster loading time.
- Add custom loading screen that contains a microgame.
- Add presets packs to quickly start a new game or add advanced features.
- Editor outline option for shapes.
- Vertical align for text.
